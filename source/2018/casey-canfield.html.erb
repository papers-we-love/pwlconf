      <h3 id="title">The Future of the Grid: Policy, Technology, and Market Changes</h3>

      <p>The electricity grid is widely regarded as one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th century. However, new pressures to improve sustainability, reliability, and resiliency while maintaining or reducing costs indicate that the status quo is not acceptable. New technologies, such as the Internet of Things and microgrids, open up a whole new way to design, maintain, and operate the grid. However, regulatory uncertainty, expectations about consumer participation, and equity concerns all serve to complicate the question: What’s the right path forward?</p>
