og_video_description: "The talk will touch on three protocols from this family and relate them to each other: The first, Rumor Mongering, spreads gossip in each call. This protocol was invented at Xerox PARC for the purpose of synchronizing replicas in the Clearinghouse directory service. The second, Name Dropper, pushes new neighbors in each call. This protocol was developed at Akamai for network discovery in a partially connected network. The third, SWIM, pulls a heartbeat in each call. This mechanism was developed at Cornell University in order to implement scalable failure detection."
