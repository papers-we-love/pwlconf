  <h3>Design Philosophy in Networked Systems</h3>
  <p>In this talk, I will present three of the great papers on the philosophy of how one designs networked systems.</p>
  <p>There will be no graphs or performance benchmarks! Using the Internet as a reference, we will discuss the careful reasoning behind system design choices and how they effect other computer systems, human users, and even human society.</p>
  <p>We will start with some technical themes: How do low-level systems choices impact high-level application capabilities?</p>
  <p>We will end with some human themes: How do low-level systems choices reflect moral choices that impact high level societal tussles?</p>

  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>Justine Sherry is joining Carnegie Mellon University as an assistant professor in Fall 2017. Her interests are in computer networking; her work includes middleboxes, networked systems, measurement, cloud computing, and congestion control. Her recent research focuses on new opportunities and challenges arising from the deployment of middleboxes -- such as firewalls and proxies -- as services offered by clouds and ISPs. Justine received her PhD (2016) and MS (2012) from UC Berkeley, and her BS and BA (2010) from the University of Washington.</p>

  <p>She is a recipient of the David J. Sakrison prize, paper awards at USENIX NSDI and ACM SIGCOMM, and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Most importantly, she is always on the lookout for a great cappuccino.</p>
