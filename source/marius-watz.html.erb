og_video_description: "In this talk, we will examine the roots and realities of what has come to be known by the awkward label creative code 2. In reality, this bland terms covers a wide range of creative practices, all based on the use of code and algorithms as both pragmatic tools and creative materials in their own right. From generative visuals based on math, to custom data visualizations and architectural designs articulated as parametric systems, the description of aesthetic ideas as software systems has enabled a new creative paradigm based on computation."
