    <p class="f4 lh-copy"><a href="http://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love</a> is an organization that brings academic research closer to practitioners through community building. Not only are we building bridges between academia and industry, we also bridge oceans, cultures, and disciplines. We are over 30 chapters Internationally, all sharing the same enthusiasm to learn from and connect with classical and contemporary research.</p>

    <p class="f4 lh-copy">Initiatives like our curated repository of papers, recorded talks, and an organization-wide (and conference) code of conduct are adopted and enjoyed by a growing base. Our mission is to bring ideas closer to the people who seek them.</p>

    <p class="f4 lh-copy">2019's PWLConf will be our fourth official Papers We Love Conference. Our previous conferences featured fantastic speakers from varying backgrounds, presenting on everything from designing network systems and bias in algorithm development to research techniques used in real-world gaming engines and software engineering research.</p>

    <h2 class="f3 fw5 pt4">Why should you consider sponsoring PWLConf?</h2>

    <p class="f4 lh-copy">The audience for PWLConf is a diverse amalgam of software and hardware engineers, industry professionals, professors, and students of various levelsâ€”just like those who attend our local chapters. We showcase the most interesting work at the intersection of industry and academia and discuss whatâ€™s next!</p>

    <p class="f4 lh-copy">We've put together a selection of sponsorship packages to suit different budgets and desired levels of visibility. We are happy to work with sponsors to come up with creative ideas beyond a standard package.</p>
