  <h1 class="f1">About Papers We Love Conf</h1>

  <div class="fl w-100 w-two-thirds-ns pv2">
    <p class="f4 lh-copy"><strong>Papers We Love</strong> began as a repository of academic computer science papers. It quickly morphed into an international series of monthly meetups. It flowered into a diverse community of computer enthusiasts interested in research as a hobby or applied to their daily work.</p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy"><strong>Papers We Love Conference</strong> is a one day event to cross-pollinate ideas between academic research and industrial practice. We were very excited to be back in St. Louis as part of the Strangeloop Pre-Conf program for the fourth year in a row.</p>
