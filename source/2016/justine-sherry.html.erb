og_video_description: "In this talk, I will present three of the great papers on the philosophy of how one designs networked systems. There will be no graphs or performance benchmarks! Using the Internet as a reference, we will discuss the careful reasoning behind system design choices and how they effect other computer systems, human users, and even human society. We will start with some technical themes: How do low-level systems choices impact high-level application capabilities? We will end with some human themes: How do low-level systems choices reflect moral choices that impact high level societal tussles?"
