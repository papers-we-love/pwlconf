Have you thought of continuations as something that only program semanticists
and compiler implementers are concerned with? In fact, the concept of
continuations appears everywhere and is useful for everyone. In this talk,
Dr. Asai will introduce [delimited continuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimited_continuation)
from the programmer's perspective directly without requiring any program
transformation or semantic arguments. He will then show how various and
seemingly complex programs can be written simply and concisely by manipulating
delimited continuations. The goal here is to convince you that delimited
continuations are useful in day-to-day programming. Finally, Dr. Asai will
speculate on the [Curry-Howard isomorphism](http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/RSISE11/Papers/curry-howard.pdf)
of delimited continuations, which could open the door for the introduction of
delimited continuations into theorem proving.
